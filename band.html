      <p>
        We are a band from Barranquilla that aims to be a sonic amalgam, fusing psychedelic nostalgia with robust riffs
        inspired by the iconic vibe of Black Sabbath. With a meticulous focus on vintage authenticity, our music is
        characterized by saturated guitars and heavy rhythms that encapsulate the raw essence of 70s stoner rock.

          <h2 class="mb-3">Our History</h2>
          <p>
            In the dark confines of 2022, our saga arose amidst whispers of affinities and melodies. Victor, the
            visionary drummer, skillfully wove a bond between souls who had danced to ancient rhythms. The band,
            initially a tribute to the Foo Fighters, took an unexpected turn upon crossing paths with Yelka, whose
            powerful voice transformed our course. We navigated a sea of chords, exploring the limits of female-fronted
            rock, until in the stillness, Eddy revealed an ancestral truth: the call of Black Sabbath. Convinced by this
            omen, our hearts embarked on a new journey, shaping our essence in the depths of stoner. Jhoel's strings
            wove the final piece, a symphony that reverberates through the passages of time, honoring the sounds of a
            golden era. Thus, Under The Legacy was forged in darkness, embracing a raw and visceral essence that guides
            us down unknown paths on a perpetual journey.

          <p>
            Under The Legacy fuses the nostalgia of 70s heavy rock with a contemporary and conceptual vision. Our music
            is defined by dense riffs, hypnotic structures, and enveloping atmospheres that evoke dark and mythical
            worlds. The band draws influence from Black Sabbath, Kadavar, and classic horror cinema to build a powerful
            musical and visual experience.
