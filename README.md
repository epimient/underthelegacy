# Under The Legacy - Official Band Website

> A static promotional website for the heavy psych / stoner doom band, Under The Legacy.

This project is a fully responsive, multi-page website designed to serve as the band's official digital presence. It's built with a focus on a strong visual identity that reflects the band's dark, "occult rock" aesthetic.

## ✨ Features

*   **Home Page:** A full-screen hero image landing page with primary navigation and calls to action.
*   **Band Page:** A comprehensive bio page featuring:
    *   The band's origin story and artistic identity in a two-column layout.
    *   A visually styled group photo.
    *   A responsive grid of member profiles with hover-to-reveal descriptions and links to individual Instagram accounts.
*   **Merch Page:** A functional, e-commerce-style gallery for merchandise concepts.
    *   Features an interactive filter for different product categories (T-Shirts, Posters), powered by vanilla JavaScript.
    *   Includes a two-image hover effect for each product (e.g., front/back view).
    *   A "wishlist" system that directs interested fans to the band's contact email to gauge interest before production.
*   **Album, Shows, and Contact Pages:** Dedicated pages with information about releases, live performances, and contact details.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**
*   **CSS3**
*   **Bootstrap 5:** For the responsive grid and layout foundation.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript:** To power the interactive merchandise filter.
*   **Google Fonts:** For custom typography (`Cinzel` & `Inter`).

## 🚀 How to View

This is a static website. To view it, simply open any of the `.html` files (e.g., `index.html`) in a modern web browser. No server is required.

## 🎨 Design & Aesthetic

The design is intentionally dark and atmospheric, drawing inspiration from 70s heavy rock, classic horror cinema, and occult themes. The color palette, typography, and imagery work together to create an immersive experience that matches the band's sound. All content has been written in English to maintain consistency.

## 📝 Notes

*   The images for band members, the band group photo, and merchandise items are currently placeholders. To replace them, add your real images to the `assets/img/` directory and update the paths in the corresponding `.html` files.
*   The contact/wishlist functionality on `contact.html` currently directs to an email address. This can be updated to an embedded form in the future by replacing the section with a valid `<iframe>` from a service like Google Forms.
